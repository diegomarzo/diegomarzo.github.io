## Some information about us! 

We are Lupita and Diego. She is a chihuahua and I'm a developer, I have been working for the last 15 years, more or less, in iGaming in a bunch of countries doing amazing Casino Games.

I mainly developed in Java, but in the last 4-5 years I have been writing all in Kotlin, I just felt in love with it, it feels like it is writing code but with SuperPowers. I also develop in Scala, but still not my main thing, and Vanilla Javascript.

I have been working the last 3 years with AWS and these days I'm playing heavy with it.

So this is what is mainly going to be the blog about.

### We hope you enjoy our content
