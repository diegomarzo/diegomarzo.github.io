title: Setting up WireGuard client in a LightSail instance
---
In this post, we will see how we can create a cheap Lightsail instance and then connected to our network using our WireGuard VPN Client. This way we will be able to run tooling applications very cheap and they will be connected to our Network, we will use this one as a template to then install Jenkins, we will see this in another post.

*We are using Lightsail but it is very easy to extrapolate and do the same in an EC2 instance, but, usually, if the machines are inside the VPC we do not need to do anything extra here, but perhaps we need to access from there the tooling machine, in that case we can hook up the machine into WireGuard, but if you need this, usually means that **you should reconsider your Network Architecture** and perhaps the Lightsail machine should be an EC2 intance*

Careful and do not use a Golden Hammer

## Create a Lightsail instance 

Now we are going to create an LS instance in our favourite (or more convenient) zone, in my case will be Frankfurt.

*Creating an Ubuntu 18.04 instance in Frankfurt*
  
### Select an SSH key pair and select the instance plan

In our case, our lovely 3.5$ instance will be good for us and pick a name: `Jenkins-Machine-Frankfurt` for example looks like a good one and press over Create Instance.

*Cheap instances for everyone*
  
Now our instance will be created and an IP will be created for it, we do not need to worry too much about the fact it is a dynamic IP since we are going to use WireGuard to access to it and **IP Roaming** is an amazing thing.

Remember we are using the Rolls Royce of VPNs!
  
## Installing WireGuard in the new instance
  
```
 ssh -A ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP_OF_NEW_INSTANCE
```
  
The first thing we are going to do will be installed WireGuard Client in the Machine and set it up:
  
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install wireguard
```
 
***Note*** If you are asked about new versions available you can install the new ones or keep yours, I *kept the local version currently installed*.

## Creating Client configuration files in the WireGuard Server

Now we have 2 main options, we can create the keys from our client and then add into the server OR we can go now to our WireGuard server, create there the configuration file for the client, and store it, and this is what I will do:
  
Open a new terminal, access your WireGuard server with SSH and add a new client:
```
$ ssh -A ubuntu@IP-FOR-WIREGUARD-SERVER
...
ubuntu@ip-privateIp:~ $ sudo ./wireguard-install.sh add-client
Client's WireGuard IPv4: 10.0.100.60
VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
```
  
  After waiting a bit you will be presented with the QR code (Super Useful when you are installing it in a Mobile device) and the location of the file, simply **less** it:
  
```
ubuntu@ip-privateIp:~ $ sudo less /root/wg0-client.FunkyUniqueLetters.conf
```
  
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Your client private key>
Address = 10.0.100.60/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = <The server public key>
PresharedKey = <A preshared key for ++ security>
Endpoint = <PUBLIC-IP-OF-SERVER>:60005
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/16
```
  
Now, we copy this and we go to our client again. The best thing will be to create a file in our home directory called `wg0-client.conf` and we store the information there.
  
  
## Install configuration files in your new client instance

We are going to install the file as a configuration file in /etc/wireguard/
  
```
sudo install -o root -g root -m 600 wg0-client.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
  
## Enabling WireGuard Client
  
```
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
```
  
Restart your instance now with **sudo restart -h now**, you will be kicked out from the SSH connection, wait a bit and connect again. If you run **ifconfig** now you will see that the Virtual Network Interface of WireGuard has been created:
```
wg0: flags=209<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP>  mtu 8921
      inet 10.0.100.60  netmask 255.255.255.0  destination 10.0.100.60
      unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 1000  (UNSPEC)
      RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
      RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
      TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
      TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

Now you can run the following command, to hook up the start:
```
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
```
And then you can check the status:
```
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
```
Now you should be able to see that the Client is Active:
```
wg-quick@wg0.service - WireGuard via wg-quick(8) for wg0
 Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/wg-quick@.service; indirect; vendor preset: enabled)
 Active: active (exited) since Fri 2020-07-17 09:14:25 UTC; 1min 42s ago
   Docs: man:wg-quick(8)
         man:wg(8)

         https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8
Process: 834 ExecStart=/usr/bin/wg-quick up wg0 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
Main PID: 834 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```
  
## Commands to control the WireGuard client
  
Enables the Interface after the restart
```
$ sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service 
```
Starts the client
```
$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
```

Show client status
```
$ sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
```

Stops the client
```
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
```
 
## Testing connectivity

Now we should be able to ping using the private IP our server from this client:
```
$ ping 10.0.10.80
PING 10.0.10.80 (10.0.10.80) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.10.80: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.32 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.10.80: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.516 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.10.80: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.589 ms
```
  
And from YOUR own laptop, if you are connected to the VPN you should be able to Ping this machine also:
```
âžœ  ~ ping 10.0.100.60
  PING 10.0.100.60 (10.0.100.60): 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from 10.0.100.60: icmp_seq=0 ttl=63 time=74.420 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.100.60: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=74.178 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.100.60: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=79.649 ms
```
  
## Securing the Instance

The next step now will be to close down all access to our instance except the IP of our server, this way, all the communication and traffic needs to be done within the VPN
  
![general-rule](/images/ls/rule-open-ports.png)  
*General rule, note the port range*

We can do it via adding the following network rule:
  
  
  **Rule with all ports opened from the VPN machine**
  
  Our you can just specify the listening UDP port, to do so, we can update our wg0.conf in the **client** to specify the listening PORT so we do not need to have the range:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Private key>
Address = 10.0.100.60/24
ListenPort = 60005
  
[Peer]
...
```

So, with this, we are done! Our LightSail Instance is secured and hooked up to our VPN!
