## Starting point, lets create our infrastructure layer
The idea of these posts will be to create a small test application, using my favourite stack, and it looks like the following:




Pre-requisites for our Adventure:
* AWS Account
* Serverless installed
* Github account where we will have our project (This will be its own post)

Kotlin && AWS in Serverless... We can all be amigos, right?
