## Configure WireGuard Client in our Lightsail machine
Finally, install the config file on your client as /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf and start WireGuard:

# Install the config file to the WireGuard configuration directory on your
# Linux client:
sudo install -o root -g root -m 600 <username>.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

# Start the WireGuard VPN:
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0

# Check that it started properly:
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0

# Verify the connection to the AlgoVPN:
sudo wg

# See that your client is using the IP address of your AlgoVPN:
curl ipv4.icanhazip.com

# Optionally configure the connection to come up at boot time:
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
If your Linux distribution does not use systemd you can bring up WireGuard with sudo wg-quick up wg0.

  ---------------
  Create Systemd service
The WireGuard VPN can be controlled via a Systemd service so that the VPN is set up automatically when Ubuntu is started.

$ sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service 
Commands for controlling the Systemd service:

$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
  ----------------
  
  
We are going to make use of LightSail to install a Jenkins Server and we will connect it to our VPN WireGuard Server.
  
1) Create a Lightsail instance in our favourite (or more convinient) zone, in my case will be Frankfurt.
  
[instance creation](/images/ls-jenkins/instance-creation)  
*Creating an Ubuntu 18.04 instance in Frankfurt*
  
2) Select a SSH key pair and select the instance plan, in our case, our lovely 3.5$ instance will be good for us and pick a name: `Jenkins-Machine-Frankfurt` for example looks like a good one and press over Create Instance.
  
*Cheap instances for every one*
  
 
Now our instance will be created and a IP will be created for it, we do not need to worry too much about the fact it is an dynamic IP since we are going to use WireGuard to access to it and **IP Roaming** is an amazing thing
  
3) SSH to the machine, the SSH port is open.
  
  ```
   ssh -A ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP_OF_NEW_INSTANCE
  ```
  
The first thing we are going to do will be install WireGuard Client in the Machine and set it up:
  
```
  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install wireguard
```
 
***Note*** If you are asked about new versions available you can install the new ones or keep yours, I *kept the local version currenty installed*.

Now we have 2 main options, we can create the keys from our client and then add into the server OR we can go now to our WireGuard server, create there the configuration file for the client, and store it, and this is what I will do:
  
4) Open new terminal, access your WireGuard server with SSH and add a new client:
  ```
  $ ssh -A ubuntu@IP-FOR-WIREGUARD-SERVER
  ...
  ubuntu@ip-privateIp:~ $ sudo ./wireguard-install.sh add-client
  Client's WireGuard IPv4: 10.0.100.60
  VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  ```
  
  After waiting a bit you will be presented with the QR code (Super Useful when you are installing it in a Mobile device) and the location of the file, simply **less** it:
  
  ```
  ubuntu@ip-privateIp:~ $ sudo less /root/wg0-client.FunkyUniqueLetters.conf
  ```
  
  ```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Your client private key>
Address = 10.0.100.60/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = <The server public key>
PresharedKey = <A preshared key for ++ security>
Endpoint = <PUBLIC-IP-OF-SERVER>:60005
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/16
  ```
  
  Now, we copy this and we go to our client again. The best thing will be create a file in our home directory called `wg0-client.conf` and we store the information there.
  
5) Install your file as a configuration file in /etc/wireguard/
  
  ```
  sudo install -o root -g root -m 600 wg0-client.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
  ```
  
  
  sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service
  
  Restart your instance now with **sudo restart -h now**, you will be kicked out from the SSH connection, wait a bit and connect again. If you run **ifconfig** now you will see that the Virtual Network Interface of WireGuard has been created:
  ```
  wg0: flags=209<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP>  mtu 8921
        inet 10.0.100.60  netmask 255.255.255.0  destination 10.0.100.60
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 1000  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
  ```
  
  Now you can run the following command, to hook up the start:
  ```
  sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
  ```
  And then you can check the status:
  ```
  sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
  ```
  Now you should be able to see that the Client is Active:
  ```
  wg-quick@wg0.service - WireGuard via wg-quick(8) for wg0
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/wg-quick@.service; indirect; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (exited) since Fri 2020-07-17 09:14:25 UTC; 1min 42s ago
     Docs: man:wg-quick(8)
           man:wg(8)
           https://www.wireguard.com/
           https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/
           https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8
           https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8
  Process: 834 ExecStart=/usr/bin/wg-quick up wg0 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
 Main PID: 834 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
  ```
  
**Commands to control the WireGuard client:**
  ```
  # Enables the Interface after restart
  $ sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service 

  # Starts the client
  $ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
  
  # Show client status
  $ sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
  
  # Stops the client
  $ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
  ```
 
Now we should be able to ping using the private IP our server from this client:
  ```
  $ ping 10.0.10.80
  PING 10.0.10.80 (10.0.10.80) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 10.0.10.80: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.32 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.10.80: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.516 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.10.80: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.589 ms
  ```
  
And from YOUR own laptop, if you are connected to the VPN you should be able to Ping this machine also:
  ```
  âžœ  ~ ping 10.0.100.60
PING 10.0.100.60 (10.0.100.60): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.100.60: icmp_seq=0 ttl=63 time=74.420 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.100.60: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=74.178 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.100.60: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=79.649 ms
  ```
  
## Securing the Instance
 The next step now will be to close down all access to our instance except from the IP of our server, this way, all the communication and traffic needs to be done within the VPN
  
  We can do it via adding the following network rule:
  
  
  **Rule with all ports opened from the VPN machine**
  
  Our you can just specify the listening UDP port, to do so, we can update our wg0.conf in the CLIENT to specify the listening PORT so we do not need to have the range:
  ```
  [Interface]
PrivateKey = <Private key>
Address = 10.0.100.60/24
ListenPort = 60005
  
[Peer]
  ...
  ```

  So, with this we are done! Our LightSail Instance is secured and hooked up to our VPN!
